"This is my first repository, in which I'm starting my own Python journey with the help of Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" Udemy course."
"With this, I'm not only firing up my Python coding skills, but learning how to correctly use Git and GitHub along the way, so if you're seeing my repo in a disgusting state, I'd like to apologize now :D This will only be better."
